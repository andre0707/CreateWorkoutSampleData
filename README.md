# About

This is a small helper app to create workout data for the iPhone simulator.

When developing apps which work with Apple HealthKit, it is nice to have some sample data to play around with and test the app in the simulator.

This app lets you create some sample data and store it in the Health app.


Create workouts of type: *walking*, *hiking*, *running*, *cycling* and *swimming*.
Specify some edges and let this app do the rest for you.


**This app is not supposed to be used on real devices.**
